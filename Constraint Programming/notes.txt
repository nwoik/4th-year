Modelling II:
    Business sells many types of items:
        Each type:
            Fixed price
            price per items
            weight
            current stock level

        Truck:
            Max weight cap 

        Constraints:
            Choose items from stock to load onto truck without exceeding weight
            make sure profit is over a threshold
            maximize potiential profit

Modelling III:
    Bin packing
        size of obj = [s1, .. sx]
        number of data = k
        bin capacity = c

        assign obj in bins without going over the cap and every obj has a bin

        variables = {o1, ..ox, b1, ..bx}
        Constraints = {every obj has a bin,
                        b.size < b.capacity}
