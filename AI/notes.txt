Vector:
    Matrix with 1 column
    m directional Vector
    2 types, column vector and row vector
    Default is column
    Indexed from 1

Tensors:
    No dimensions
    Scalar has 0 Tensors

    Scalar addition and multiplication:
        2 vectors multiplied together makes a Scalar
        Scalar A 
        A+2 adds 2 to each element in A 
        2A multiplies every element in A 

Hadamard Product:
    Addition and multiplication of matrices that have the same direction

Matrix multiplication:
    AB = C 
    m*p = A 
    p*n = B
