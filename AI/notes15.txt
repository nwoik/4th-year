Keras Library:
    Built layer by layer
    Input layer is determined by the number of features
    Non linear models are used for hidden layer functions
    Output layer is determined by the task. 
        It's linear activation function for regression g(z) = z
        It's sigmoid activation function for binary classification
        It's softmax activation function for multiclass

    Specify the function for compilation:
        Regression: Mean squared error (mse)
        Binary classification: Binary cross entropy
        Multiclass classification: Cross entropy

    Optimizer:
        Gradient descent (SGD)
        Sticastic = 1
        Batch = size of dataset
        Mini Batch = between 1 and (size of dataset)
        Simulated annealing -> changing the learning rate

    Metrics for testing:
        Mean absolute error for testing (mae)
        Accuracy for classification
