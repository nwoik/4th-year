Normal Equation for OLS regression:
    Parameter: Target value of
    The loss function is convex 

    The minimum point is where the turning point is located
    When the gradient of the loss function is equal to 0, then thats the minimum loss

    Differenciate partially and put them into the gradient vector 

    Problems:
        Can only be used if the data set is small because the function is cubic
