Neural network Gradient ascent:
    Start with a blank image
    Modify the image to get neurons to activate

Different achitectures:
    Skip connections. Adding the outputs of multiple layers to a higher one

Different classes:
    Object localization

Image segmentation:
    Divide the image into areas

Case study: MS Teams
