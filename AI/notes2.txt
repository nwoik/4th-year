Prediction:
    Regression:
        The prediction continous values
        
    Classification:
        The prediction of discrete values 

    X = Object 
    Y = Target
    Y' = The predicted target value 

    Labeled data set:
        Every example X comes with Y
        The target values go into it's own seperate vectors

    Supervised learning:
        Instance/Example based:
            Nearest neighbour algorithm:
                Find the example that's the nearest neighbour

                Problems:
                    Noisy data sets
                    Errors in the data 

            K-nearest neighbour:
                Find several examples that's closest to object and get the average

                Fit and predict
                All the work takes place in prediction


        Model based:
            A general way of making a prediction. E.g Formula or Function
            Function/Formula is learned from the data set
            The set is infinite
            Find the algorithm approximately equal (=) to the target Function

            Fit and predict
            All the work takes place in fit
