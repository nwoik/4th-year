Model selection:
    Done before error estimation 

    Parameters and Hyperparameters:
        Parameters are the variables that the model seeks to learn. Outputs of the algorithm
        Hyperparameters are the inputs of the algorithm. These values that have to be chosen

    Done wrong:
        Randomly partition the dataset into training set and test set (e.g. 80%-20%).
        Train the predictor on the training set using one set of hyperparameter values; test it on the test set.
        If not happy with the MAE, train the predictor on the training set using a different set of hyperparameter values; test it on the test set.
        Keep doing this until you are satisfied.

        Wrong:
            Form of leakage
            Information about the test set is being used to develop the model

    Done right:
        Development set is split into the training set and validation set.
        A Validation Set is used for testing to fine tune the hyperparameters 


        This way the test set is never used throughout training of the model

    Grid Search:
        Test set is split off from data set 
        Create preprocessor
        Create a dictionary and put 

    Final model is built on the entire data set
