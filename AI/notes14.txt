Neural Networks:
    Every neuron has a bias
    z = b + xw

    Activation function g
        Linear activation: g(z) = z 
        Sigmoid activation: g(z) = 1/1+e^z
        ReLU activation: g(z) = 𝑚𝑎𝑥(0,𝑧)
        tanh activation: 𝑔(𝑧) = tanh(𝑧)

    Layers of Neurons:
        Every input is connected to every neuron. 
        n neurons and p inputs means there will be n*p wires
        G is applied elementwise
        The final output is the Target value

        Input layer: where the input values are added (not a layer)
        Hidden layer: All the layers between input and output
        Output layer: The neuron that outputs the target valye

        Amount of layers is a hyperparameter

        Feed forward: All outputs move up, there are no cycles

        Finds successive layers of representation of vectors.
        It finds new features
