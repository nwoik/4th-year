Linear equations: y = a + bx

Linear and Vectors:
    y = B0 + xB
    
    y = 12 + 3x1 +4x2 + 5x3
    B = [3,4,5]

    
    or 


    y = xb 




Linear Regression:
    The scoring function is the loss/cost function

    Squared to penalize bigger error
    Squared to make it continous 

    Ordinary least squared regression
