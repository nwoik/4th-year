Convolutional Neural Networks:
    2 dimensional arrays are passed in as the input 

    Information is destroyed when the input it flattened.

    Depth of grayscale images are 1

    For colored pictures, a rank 3 tensor is passed in 
    The depth is 3 for RGB values


    kernel size 
    The neuron is connected to a 3x3 neuron
    Neuron connections have overlapping connections.

    Corresponding  wieghts on different neurons are the same

    Parameters are weights and biases 


Max Pooling:
    The goal of max pooling is to make the network smaller
    Advantage:
        Fewer parameters helps with overfitting
        Faster computation
        Less memory used 

    Max pooling neurons don't usually overlap 

    No weights in max pooling 

    It takes the makew of the pooling
