Genetic Algorithms:
    Evolution:
        Inheritence:
            Inherits characteristics from parents

        Variation:
            Individuals can vary  
            mutation (copying errors)

        Fitness:
            Anything that makes it better adapted to an enviroment
            Lesser characteristics are eliminated  

    Genetic Algorithms:
        n: number of individuals in the population
        x: amount of crossover
        k: which generation we're on
        u: percentage of mutation

        Create population from 

        Select
        Mutation is done on the new generation

        Agents have to be converted into bit strings (encode and decode)
        Tables are made of a row per percept

        action^2 

    Fitness:
        Fitness function is task specific
        Fitness should be measured multiple times

    Copy:
        Roulette wheel selection:
            Agents are chosen in proportion to their fitness
            Individual's fitness/total of fitness

        Rank selection:
            Agents are ordered by fitness
            Position/Sum of position

        Tournament selection:
            Select a number of agents at random n times 
            Take the fittest of each selection

    Crossover:
        Same mechanisms as copying used to pick mates
        Random amounts of bits from mates are used to make new mates 

        Single Point:
            Pick a random position on both mates
             ^: m1 

    Mutation:
        All agents have the same chance of mutation
        Flipping 1 bit from the agent 

    Problems:
        Crowding:
            Lack of diversity in the population
            Risk of stagnation

            Fix:
                Increase mutation rate
                Don't use Roulette selection
