Recommender Systems III:
    Orignal matrix has high dimensions and is sparse U*I
    Embeddings (dense vectors) are created from original. Full of latent features.
    The features are learned rather than chosen
    A predicted rating is created from U*I and adding the mean

    dimensions are a hyperparameter

    Learning:
        All vectors are initialized randomly
        For each known rating, mean + U*I  
        If the prediction is wrong, change the weights 
        MSE is used
        
    Matrix completion:
        All the blanks are filled in the original matrix

    Pros:
        No need to ask users for input data 
        Fast predictions, can be incremental

    Top N recommendation:
        Top N diversity:
            diversity is calculated by finding the similar of each feature/ratings 

        Prone to feedback loops
