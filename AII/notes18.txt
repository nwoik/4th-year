Problems with supervised learning:
    Confidence levels are unreliable
    Not robust to resist attacks
    Fragile. E.g Fails on test set examples when they're negative
    Biased. Inherits bias of the dataset it's trained on. Selection bias, 
    Trust.
    Changes in the world, world changes to enviroment it's been trained in. Training set isn't representitive of what it should be now
    
AGI:
    Common sense:
        Does not have implied knowledge
        Cannot solve ambigous problems without world knowledge
