Delibrative agents:
    Problems with not thinking ahead:
        Suboptimal solution with higher cost
        Hitting dead ends

    Problems with thinking ahead:
        In dynamic enviroments, opportunities can pass to execute actions

    Planning sequences:
        Static enviroments:
            Take inputs from percepts -> Create a plan -> Execute whole plan 

        Dynamic enviroments:
            Take inputs from percepts -> Create a plan -> Execute first step -> repeat

    Explicit State space: (Exam Q)
        All states reachable by sequences of actions

        Graph represented by nodes and edges
        Stored with adjencency matrix and list
        
    Implicit State space:
        Define start state,
        A sequence of actions to get to other states 
        Define Goal condition

    Solution:
        Path that takes you from the start state, to the goal state
