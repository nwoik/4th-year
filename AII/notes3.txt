Language model:
    In english, it estimates the probability of each possible string of words

    A multiclass classifier is used to make the model
    Softmax is used for the probabilities of the words 
    
    Character classifier is much easier because the amount of classes is much smaller

    Self supervised learning:
        The label in the recurring neural net is in the output being passed back in 

    Generating text using the language model:
        The model is made stochastic
        Instead of picking the most likely, it will pick based on it's probabilities.
