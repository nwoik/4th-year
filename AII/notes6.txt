Recommender Systems:
    Problems:
        Some people use the rating scale differently
        Popularity bias 

    Non-Personalized recommender:

    Adv
        No need for signup forms
        Can recommend new things outside set boundries

    Cons
        Slow because it has to calculate the similarity between all the candidates then recommned.
        Work done at predict
