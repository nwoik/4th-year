Deep Q Learning:
    DQN - Deep Q Network
    Output - Q values 

    1st Architecture:
        Inputs foreach sensor in binary
        Inputs foreach function

        Output is 1 number
        Linear output function for the output layer
        It's run N times for the number of actions 

    2nd Architecture:
        Inputs foreach sensor in binary

        Output is N numbers for each action
