    R - interactions matrix UI

    Problems:

            Most of the matrix is empty
        Cold-start items:
            New products added have no ratings
            In some domains, new items are the most common (news)

        Cold-start users:
            New users have no ratings 
            Infrequent users have very little data
            In some domains, new users are the most common (shopping)

    Recommender Systems Architecture:
        Candidate generation:
            Candidates are domain specific

        Scoring:

        Top-N recommendation:
