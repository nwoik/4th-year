Agents: Q2 on exam 
    Anything that perceives it's enviroment using it's sensors and acts upon it using its effectors.

    Sensors takes percepts (inputs)
    Effectors performs actions

    Robots:
        Agents that are embodied, situated in a physical enviroments
        E.g Vacuum cleaner, self driving cars

    Software agents:
        Situated in virtual enviroments
        Effectors modify data structures
        E.g NPCs in video games, recommendations

    Sense, Plan, Act:
        Sense the enviroment
        Decide on an action
        Carry out the action

    Action function:
        From percepts, actions are chosen
        Intelligent agents are autonomous and rational.

    Enviroments:
        Fully observable vs partially observable
            Fully observable: All the information in an enviroment is available E.g chess board
            Partially observable: Only some info in the enviroment is available

        Deterministic vs stochastic
            Deterministic: The same action will get the same outcome
            Stochastic: The same action might not get the same outcome 

        Single-step vs Sequencial
            Single-step: Decisions are made independently without needing previous or the next step
            Sequencial: Decisions are made based on previous and potential information

        Static vs Dynamic
            Static: Enviroment doesn't change while making the decision 
            Dynamic: Enviroment changes while decisions are being made 

        Discrete vs Continous:
            Discrete: There's a finite set of actions
            Continous: There's an infinite set of actions

        Single agent vs Multi agent
            Single agent: Only one agent acting in the enviroment
            Multi agent: Multiple agents acting in the enviroment

    Agents:
        Reactive:
            Takes in percept and makes a single step decision based on the percept

        Delibrative:
            Thinks ahead and makes decisions based on potential future percepts

    Table Driven Agent: (reactive)
        s = Sense() # s is a vector
        a = Lookup(s, table)
        Execute(a)

    000 = move
    001 = right
    010 = move
    011 = move 
    100 = Left
    101 = Left
    110 = Left
    111 = Left
