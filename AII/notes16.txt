State Space Search (Path Finding): (Applied AI)
    Roadmaps:
        Explicit state spaces (adjancency matrix)
        Nodes:
            Junctions/Intersections
            Entrances and Exits to car parks
            Bridges/Tunnels
            Speed limit changes
        Edges:
            Roads are represented by 2 edges for each direction
            Roads are weighed in distance/speed = time

        Must be able to recalculate quickly in case a user turns off the optimal path 
        Recalculation > Optimality
        Branching factor: Amount of edges a node has 

    NPCs:
        Path finding in a grid based game:
            Axial games only have vertical and horizontal movement
            To avoid enemies, then stick higher costs on the tiles closer to the enemies
            Nodes for only waypoints are more efficient
